## Algorithms

The algorithms used:

### Pathfinding

Little pathfinding for enemies, by simply check which squeare that they will move next is closer to the PacMan by pixels, an choosing the closest one with a 60 percent of chance; only if our little Pacman is not on superberry effect and able to consume them...

### Threading

Threading was used to make the animation for movement of the Pacman and enemies smoother and more accurate.

### Engine

All the system created and used are also in this repository [PyGameEngine](https://github.com/ErtyumPX/PyGameEngine). It includes scene management system, various scene transitions, render manager and also the UI Elemenets created from scrtach.
